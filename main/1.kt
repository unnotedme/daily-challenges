/*
challenge #1 - is it an anagram?
dfficulty: avarage

write a function that receives two words (strings) and returns true or false (boolean) according to the anagrams.
- an anagram consists of forming a word by rearranging all the letters of another initial word.
- it is not necessary to verify if both words exists.
- two words that are exactly the same are not an anagram.
