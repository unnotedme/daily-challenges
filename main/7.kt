/*
#7 - counting words
difficulty: average

create a program that counts how many times each word is repeated and that shows the final count of all of them.
- the scoring signs do not form part of the word.
- a word is the same as it appears in uppercase and lowercase.
- it is not possible to use the language's own functions that will automatically reset it.
